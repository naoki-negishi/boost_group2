## 🚀 Quick Start Example

Here's a complete example of using the Literature Manager:

```javascript
// Example: Processing a research paper
const paper = {
    title: "Attention Is All You Need",
    authors: ["Vaswani, A.", "Shazeer, N."],
    abstract: "We propose a new simple network architecture...",
    keywords: ["attention", "transformer", "neural networks"],
    pdfUrl: "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf"
};

// Upload and analyze
await literatureManager.uploadPaper(paper);

// Perform clustering
await literatureManager.performClustering();

// Search for related papers
const results = await literatureManager.search("transformer architecture");

// Generate summary
const summary = await literatureManager.generateSummary(results);
```
